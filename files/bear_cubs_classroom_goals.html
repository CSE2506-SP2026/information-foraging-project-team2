          The nursery school ensures that our school environment is safe,
          healthy and conducive to children's exploration and independence.
          Our teachers encourage students to:

          <li>
            Cultivate a child's positive self image, both as an individual and
            as a member of the classroom community.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn how to establish positive, constructive relationships with
            others as they form friendships and work and play together.
          </li>
          <li>Develop independence in a supportive group setting.</li>
          <li>Care for and respect their learning environment.</li>
