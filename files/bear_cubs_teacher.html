            <h3>Marsha Graeber</h3>
            <p class="staff-qualifications">BS Parks and Recreation</p>
            <p>
            Marsha Graeber has taught at WUNS for 20 years. She currently works
            with the Bear Cubs in the morning and the Panda Bears in the
            afternoon. Marsha’s enthusiasm in the classroom is contagious. Her
            greatest joy in working with children is to provide a positive
            environment to support self-discovery, independence, resilience,
            confidence, curiosity, self-regulation and a strong self-esteem. She
            treasures all the relationships with children and their families
            cultivated over the years. Marsha believes that WUNS is a special
            place to teach because of the talented, respectful staff, the unique
            experiences of the children, and the open communication that the
            school community supports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her Bachelor of Science degree in outdoor parks and recreation was
            attained at the University of Missouri in Columbia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marsha is married to husband Ken; they have two daughters, Emily and
            Sarah. The whole family appreciates being active in the outdoors,
            enjoying running, golf, biking, hiking and working in the garden.
            The Graebers are also avid Cardinal baseball fans!

            <h3>Katie Loynd</h3>
            <p class="staff-qualifications">
              BS Elementary Education, MAEd Teaching, <br>
              Early Childhood Education
            </p>
            <p>
            Katie is very excited to begin her fifth year at WUNS, teaching with Chona in the Teddy Bear classroom
            (mornings) and Colleen in the Sun Bear classroom (afternoons). She
            has taught kindergarten, first and second grades in the Ladue School
            District for many years.
          </p>
          <p>
            She attained her undergraduate degree in elementary education from
            Creighton University and her Master of Arts in teaching early
            education from Webster University. Katie is inspired by young
            children; she is constantly amazed by how they see the joy in simple
            things. One of her goals as a teacher is to provide an enriching
            environment that naturally fosters curiosity, engaging
            conversations, imaginative play, creative movement, and thoughtful
            expression. She believes WUNS is a special place because of its warm
            and welcoming energy and its unique location on a college campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Katie and her husband Mike are St. Louis natives. They have four
            children, Alli (21), Jake (19), Elizabeth (17) and Will (14) and a
            dog Murphy, “the best West Highland White Terrier ever.” In her free
            time, Katie enjoys hiking, travel, swimming and being with her
            family.
