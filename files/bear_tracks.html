      <h1>Bear Tracks</h1>
      <h2>
        The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities
        for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who
        attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but
        perhaps not full-day schedules.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Bear Tracks is offered Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.,
        for afternoon students and Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. – 2:30
        p.m., for morning students. Parents may enroll their children for
        participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear
        Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are
        designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on
        learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement
        or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might take a nature hike one
        day, create an art project the next, or dramatize a story in any
        particular week.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress
        children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and
        creative curriculum. Children must be toilet-trained to enroll in Bear
        Tracks.
