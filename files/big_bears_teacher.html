            <p class="staff-qualifications">
              AB Education, MAT Early Childhood Education
            </p>
            <p>
            Suzy Frillman has taught in the early education field since 1996.
            She joined the WUNS staff in 2001. Her undergraduate degree is in
            art education (K – 12) from Missouri State University. She also
            attained a Master of Arts in early childhood education from Webster
            University.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suzy teaches in the Big Bear classroom and is the art specialist at
            WUNS, bringing her passion for teaching art through literature and
            hands-on experiences to the children. She also coordinates the
            afternoon Bear Tracks program. Suzy believes that WUNS is a special
            place to teach because of the diversity of the families and the
            school’s commitment to the developmental needs of the students.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is married to her terrific husband Adam and her lovely daughter
            Sydney (a nursery school alum). Outside of school, Suzy enjoys time
            with her family, taking walks, enjoying nature, making art,
            practicing yoga, and watching Sydney play soccer.

            <h3>Heather Huewe</h3>
            <p class="staff-qualifications">
              AB Speech Communication, <br>
              MAT Early Childhood Education
            </p>
            <p>
            Heather Huewe is thrilled to begin her third year teaching at WUNS.
            After staying home for several years to raise four daughters,
            Heather eagerly returned to the classroom and found WUNS to be a
            wonderful fit. Heather was drawn to WUNS for its warm, family
            environment, its collegiality, its professionalism, and the
            opportunity to work not only with young children but also with young
            adults from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to having her
            daughters, Heather taught first, sixth, and eighth grade over the
            course of twelve years at MICDS, and developed a love for each age
            group. She teams with Suzy in the morning Big Bears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heather earned her BA in Speech and Communications from the
            University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Tarheels!) and an
            MAT in Early Childhood Education from Emory University.
          </p>
          <p>
            A devoted runner for her entire adult life, she will begin coaching
            her tenth season of Girls on the Run this fall, and has completed
            several marathons for charity. Heather is most proud of coordinating
            the annual Race for Refugees, which benefits the International
            Institute of St. Louis. This venture combines her love of running
            with her belief in giving back to our shared community. In her free
            time Heather loves to stay active and get outside with her kind
            husband – and fellow educator – Patrick, their four unique daughters
            Rosie, Grace, Anna, and Mary Catherine, and crazy pup Charlie.
            Together they like to walk to their friendly Olivette neighborhood
            Starbucks, ride bikes to the bookstore (more coffee!), go to the
            zoo, play tennis and soccer, and of course run. Heather also loves
            to read, bake, keep up with current events, and stay connected with
            friends, family, and neighbors (a.k.a. talk…just ask her family!).
