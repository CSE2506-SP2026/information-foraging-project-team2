      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <h2>Our Preschool Curriculum</h2>
    <p>
      At Washington University Nursery School, we believe every child is a unique individual 
      with their own pace and pattern of development. Our curriculum is child-centered, 
      play-based, and grounded in Constructivist philosophy. We create meaningful learning 
      experiences that nurture the whole child — socially, emotionally, intellectually, and physically.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Educational Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Guided by the work of theorists such as Piaget, Dewey, and Vygotsky, we believe children 
      learn best through active exploration and meaningful experiences.

      experiences are adapted to meet individual needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year. The Fall conference is informal 
      and focused on sharing progress and experiences. The Spring conference includes 
      a written assessment covering all areas of development to provide a well-rounded 
      picture of each child.
