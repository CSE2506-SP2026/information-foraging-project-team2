                We’ve seen definite growth in our child’s social-emotional
                skills, and we appreciate that the teachers encourage
                independence and resolution of conflict between the children
                to allow them to get comfortable using these skills.

                play-based (as it should be!) program.

                The program has brought a structure and discipline and
                prepared my (child) well for kindergarten this year. I was
                amazed how the teachers cleverly integrated a variety of
                science/math/art/craft concepts into the curriculum so well.

                The indoor and outdoor play areas are very nice, but what
                makes the school so special are the teachers and the caring,
                cooperative, loving atmosphere they foster among the students
                and throughout the classroom activities.

                I particularly like the walks the class takes around campus.
                Those stick with (my child) and provide a wonderful learning
                opportunity and change of scenery.

                She felt completely comfortable with other children and gained
                confidence for herself. I believe that she knows how much she
                is loved by teachers and children.

                My child almost always gets back in the car happy (and often
                times worn out!) about her full morning. She adores her
                teachers and has made friends. I like that there is a free
                choice environment while still maintaining routine/structure.
                She also seems to particularly enjoy art class!

                The school is tidy and the kids seem to feel ownership over
                taking care of their space. The outdoor amenities are safe and
                messy and fun and just right for Pre-K.

        The Panda Bear class is the afternoon session for 2 1/2 – and
        3-year-old children. Teachers design a variety of engaging activities
        that gradually encourage children to interact and communicate with
        others. The indoor classroom and outdoor playground are safe,
        interesting spaces for Panda Bears to explore and make sense of their
        world.
