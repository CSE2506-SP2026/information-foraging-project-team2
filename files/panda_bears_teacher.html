            <h3>Chona Carson</h3>
            <p class="staff-qualifications">AB Physchology, MAEd</p>
            <p>
            Chona is beginning her 13th year as a teacher in the Nursery School.
            She teams with Marbie in the Teddy Bear classroom and Marsha in the
            Panda Bear classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chona has over 20 years of experience in the early childhood
            education field. Her degrees include a Bachelor of Arts in
            psychology from the University of Kansas and a Master of Arts in
            teaching from Webster University. Chona’s favorite times with the
            WUNS children include art activities—she enjoys watching them create
            using different media. Circle time is another favorite of hers, when
            children enjoy listening to stories and predicting what happens
            next, as well as singing and counting to teacher-led prompts. For
            Chona, WUNS is a very special place to teach because of the diverse
            families that enroll. She also appreciates working with her
            teammates and collaborating with the other teachers on staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chona is married with two children in college. During her free time,
            she loves to spend time with her family, read, garden and walk her
            dogs.

            <h3>Marsha Graeber</h3>
            <p class="staff-qualifications">BS Parks and Recreation</p>
            <p>
            Marsha Graeber has taught at WUNS for 20 years. She currently works
            with the Bear Cubs in the morning and the Panda Bears in the
            afternoon. Marsha’s enthusiasm in the classroom is contagious. Her
            greatest joy in working with children is to provide a positive
            environment to support self-discovery, independence, resilience,
            confidence, curiosity, self-regulation and a strong self-esteem. She
            treasures all the relationships with children and their families
            cultivated over the years. Marsha believes that WUNS is a special
            place to teach because of the talented, respectful staff, the unique
            experiences of the children, and the open communication that the
            school community supports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her Bachelor of Science degree in outdoor parks and recreation was
            attained at the University of Missouri in Columbia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marsha is married to husband Ken; they have two daughters, Emily and
            Sarah. The whole family appreciates being active in the outdoors,
            enjoying running, golf, biking, hiking and working in the garden.
            The Graebers are also avid Cardinal baseball fans!
