          The nursery school ensures that our school environment is safe,
          healthy and conducive to children's exploration and independence.
          Our teachers encourage students to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Feel comfortable and secure, developing the understanding that
            learning is fun.
          </li>
          <li>
            Respect themselves and others, focusing on promoting kindness,
            empathy and cooperation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use their natural wonder and curiosity to explore and make
            connections to the world around them.
          </li>
          <li>Think and act more independently.</li>
          <li>Feel successful about their accomplishments, big or small.</li>
          <li>Grow socially, physically and cognitively.</li>
        </ul>
