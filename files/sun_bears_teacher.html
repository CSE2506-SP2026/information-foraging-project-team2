            <p class="staff-qualifications">

            Colleen Corbett begins her seventh year as a teacher at WUNS,
            teaming for the sixth year with Katie in the Sun Bear classroom. She
            also is the Spanish specialist, teaching once weekly lessons to all
            the classrooms. In addition, Colleen coordinates the morning Bear
            Tracks program and maintains the WUNS website. She worked in the
            student technology and training department for five years at
            Washington University prior to transferring to the nursery school in
            2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before coming to Washington University, she taught second grade for
            nine years at The College School. Her degrees include a Bachelor of
            Arts in English, with minors in Spanish, writing, and women’s
            studies, and a Master of Education, both attained from the
            University of Missouri. Additional graduate school hours in early
            childhood education and writing were attained at Webster University
            and Washington University in St. Louis. Her favorite activity with
            the children is sharing literature that connects to experiences in
            the classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Colleen loves to travel and play in the outdoors with her wonderful,
            over-functioning but humble husband. They live in Webster Groves
            with their fur-daughter, a mutt named Sadie who thinks she’s a
            princess. Their biological daughter is finally launched–she is a
            resident physician at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital.

            <h3>Katie Loynd</h3>
            <p class="staff-qualifications">
              BS Elementary Education, MAEd Teaching, <br>
              Early Childhood Education
            </p>
            <p>
              Katie is very excited to begin her fifth year at WUNS, teaching with Chona in the Teddy Bear classroom
              (mornings) and Colleen in the Sun Bear classroom (afternoons). She
              has taught kindergarten, first and second grades in the Ladue School
              District for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
              She attained her undergraduate degree in elementary education from
              Creighton University and her Master of Arts in teaching early
              education from Webster University. Katie is inspired by young
              children; she is constantly amazed by how they see the joy in simple
              things. One of her goals as a teacher is to provide an enriching
              environment that naturally fosters curiosity, engaging
              conversations, imaginative play, creative movement, and thoughtful
              expression. She believes WUNS is a special place because of its warm
              and welcoming energy and its unique location on a college campus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Katie and her husband Mike are St. Louis natives. They have four
              children, Alli (21), Jake (19), Elizabeth (17) and Will (14) and a
              dog Murphy, “the best West Highland White Terrier ever.” In her free
              time, Katie enjoys hiking, travel, swimming and being with her
              family.
