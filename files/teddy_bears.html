                The indoor and outdoor play areas are very nice, but what
                makes the school so special are the teachers and the caring,
                cooperative, loving atmosphere they foster among the students
                and throughout the classroom activities.

                I particularly like the walks the class takes around campus.
                Those stick with (my child) and provide a wonderful learning
                opportunity and change of scenery.

                We really appreciated the consistent diversity of activities.
                Our (child) started off gravitating towards particular things,
                but by the end of the year had started to engage more in
                activities our (child) used to shy away from.

                We’ve seen definite growth in our child’s social-emotional
                skills, and we appreciate that the teachers encourage
                independence and resolution of conflict between the children
                to allow them to get comfortable using these skills.

        Our classes focus on social development and learning through play.
        Each year’s class builds on the previous year’s program in curriculum
        experiences and activities offered. The classrooms are set up to
        invite exploration and foster a lifelong love of learning. Our staff
        is deeply committed to the young child and the importance of early
        childhood education.

      <p>
        Twos/Young Threes: Children must turn 3 by February 1 of that school
        year. The focus of this class is on social development and learning
        through play. Separating from parents, learning to take direction, and
        being nurtured by people outside of immediate family are important
        milestones for this age. The building of trust and growing peer
        awareness are enhanced by a safe environment that provides a
        foundation for learning.

        The Teddy Bear class is the morning session for 2 1/2 – and 3-year-old
        children. Teachers design a variety of engaging activities that
        gradually encourage children to interact and communicate with others.
        The indoor classroom and outdoor playground are safe, interesting
        spaces for Teddy Bears to explore and make sense of their world.
