            <p class="staff-qualifications">AB Physchology, MAEd</p>
            <p>
            Chona is beginning her 13th year as a teacher in the Nursery School.
            She teams with Marbie in the Teddy Bear classroom and Marsha in the
            Panda Bear classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chona has over 20 years of experience in the early childhood
            education field. Her degrees include a Bachelor of Arts in
            psychology from the University of Kansas and a Master of Arts in
            teaching from Webster University. Chona’s favorite times with the
            WUNS children include art activities—she enjoys watching them create
            using different media. Circle time is another favorite of hers, when
            children enjoy listening to stories and predicting what happens
            next, as well as singing and counting to teacher-led prompts. For
            Chona, WUNS is a very special place to teach because of the diverse
            families that enroll. She also appreciates working with her
            teammates and collaborating with the other teachers on staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chona is married with two children in college. During her free time,
            she loves to spend time with her family, read, garden and walk her
            dogs.

            <h3>Katie Loynd</h3>
            <p class="staff-qualifications">
              BS Elementary Education, MAEd Teaching, <br>
              Early Childhood Education
            </p>
            <p>
            Katie is very excited to begin her fifth year at WUNS, teaching with Chona in the Teddy Bear classroom
            (mornings) and Colleen in the Sun Bear classroom (afternoons). She
            has taught kindergarten, first and second grades in the Ladue School
            District for many years.
          </p>
          <p>
            She attained her undergraduate degree in elementary education from
            Creighton University and her Master of Arts in teaching early
            education from Webster University. Katie is inspired by young
            children; she is constantly amazed by how they see the joy in simple
            things. One of her goals as a teacher is to provide an enriching
            environment that naturally fosters curiosity, engaging
            conversations, imaginative play, creative movement, and thoughtful
            expression. She believes WUNS is a special place because of its warm
            and welcoming energy and its unique location on a college campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Katie and her husband Mike are St. Louis natives. They have four
            children, Alli (21), Jake (19), Elizabeth (17) and Will (14) and a
            dog Murphy, “the best West Highland White Terrier ever.” In her free
            time, Katie enjoys hiking, travel, swimming and being with her
            family.
